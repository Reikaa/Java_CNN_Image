1. Current input Map Size is 28*28, could make it larger(32*32, 64*64 etc...), then the quality maybe higher, or even don't zoom in the image, use the original size of image.
2. Use RGB value instead of binarized value as input of CNN
3. Set min-batch larger, it depends on the CPU/memory of server
4. load more training image
